# 348-Project

We finished all of stage 2 except getting our app to work. We belive that it has something to do with the way it is reading or in this case not reading the input and transferring it to the database. 

However, we have a database up and running and we have data stored in it. 
We have shared the documents for stage 2 to a google drive folder and have shared it with the TA.
